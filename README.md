Update 29 Oct. 2018: This was my very first try at creating a website.
Previous knowledge at that point: 0
Allowed frameworks: 0
The website is a nightmare from the clean code point of view. However, a keen eye can notice (if anyone would want to try to decipher this) the progress that was made from page to page, which refers to everything (HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, layout, etc.).

Obviously, the things I have done could have been done in a better way.
